#### This is a work-in-progress repo containing all the Ansible playbooks that I use for deploying and managing my home network environment.

#### These playbooks/roles could be broken, have bugs and issues, or are unfinished. Do not copy from these expecting them to work in your environment or at all. I will be writing documentation and adding comments to them when I have the majority of them completed to meet my needs.

I have roles for creating, cloning and managing Proxmox VMs, and taking snapshots. Performing updates and configuration of Linux (Ubuntu/Debian based) systems: including installing packages, configuring SNMP, mounting network shares, installing Cockpit for web management and general purpose update, restart and shutdown commands. I also have roles for installing and managing Docker and Docker Swarm, container deployment and image pruning. And deployment of GlusterFS on linux systems.
